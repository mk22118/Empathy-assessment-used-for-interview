# Empathy-assessment-used-for-interview
The project  developed  an ML model to predict an empathy score with eye-tracker for candidates who are being interviewed.

	#Project Description: 
	The relevant features from the eye-tracking data have been extracted and further applying machine learning algorithms create 
	a predictive model for assessing empathy. An analysis was conducted on the collected data from two groups performing different activities: 
	foraging visual information and visual communication. To obtain accurate empathy score predictions, effective features were extracted after analyzing the dataset.
	These predicted empathy scores were then verified through provided questionnaire assessments.
